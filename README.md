# User Profiles Selector

When downpatching the game version, user profiles are reset. This mod allows you to set a custom folder for your profiles, preventing them from being overwritten.

For downpatching, visit: [https://bage.cab/ror2/downpatch](https://bage.cab/ror2/downpatch).

You can manually copy your profiles to this folder: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<number>\632360\remote`.
