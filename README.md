# User Profiles Selector

When changing the game version, user profiles are reset. This mod lets you set a custom folder for your profiles, making it easier to manage multiple game versions simultaneously.

For downpatching, visit: [https://bage.cab/ror2/downpatch](https://bage.cab/ror2/downpatch).

You can manually copy your profiles to this folder: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<number>\632360\remote`.
